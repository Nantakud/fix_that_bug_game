It is a simple game, built using phaser library.


Storyline
The poor dev is on the line... he makes too many mistakes, and his boss is not happy. Help him catch all the bugs before they run away. If he is not fast enough with the fix, he will be fired!


Improvements
- direction of fix. Right now it comes from one side, it would be better from below
- Scores and lives text. At the very beginning, before any changes in the value, the text is not displayed with the right font.
- Bugs direction. The bug image does not rotate accordingly with the path
- Cover and gameover animation. The bugs are immobile. It would be cool if they'd move.
